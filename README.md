# Wide baseline stereo matching task (Computer vision)
This repository contains my implementation of the complete wide baseline stereo matching task (see: https://ducha-aiki.github.io/wide-baseline-stereo-blog/posts/2020-03-27-intro.html for more information) written in python using pytorch predominantly.

# Script usage
Running wbs_main.py executes the whole pipeline and finds the best homography between 2 images from the set of test images in directory 'bikes'.
